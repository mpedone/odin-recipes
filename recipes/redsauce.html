    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the simplest tomato sauce you will make, and it will become your go-to sauce, especially when you need sauce in a hurry. It is perfect for pasta, is great on pizza (with a slight modification), is literally made for baked dishes, and is so good you might just want to eat it with a spoon on it's own. The key is not just using good quality tomatoes - that is a given for any tomato sauce - but rather in an ingredient you wouldn't expect in a tomato sauce: anchovies. Specifically for this recipe, anchovy paste. It sounds odd, especially if you're like me, and the thought of putting an anchovy in your mouth makes you physically revulsed, but take a moment and ask yourself if you like Caeser dressing. If so, you understand the what happens when an ingredient is used to highlight those around it, rather than being the star itself. Anchovy is a magic little fish that can left the flavors of everything else in a dish, making them sing.</p>
    <p>The longer the sauce cooks, the more it will dry out, and the more concentrated the flavors will become. This is the key to a flavorful sauce. Save the liquid from draining the tomatoes, and then add it in at the end to get your sauce to your desired consistency. If using this for pizza, you'll want to cook it for a while, and ad no liquid. Get that sauce nice and thick and concentrated!</p>
