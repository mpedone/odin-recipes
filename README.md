# odin-recipes
This is the first project for The Odin Project's Fundamentals course. I will be building a website that has some recipes. I assume this is a reference to the old joke about what computers are good for: storing recipes, which, to be fair is probably a significant chunk of what I use the Internet for.

This is also a good way to practice the Git workflow, making changes, staging and committing often, writing good commit comments, and all of that.
